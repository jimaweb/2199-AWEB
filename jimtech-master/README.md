# JimTech Website
JimTech is a responsive website I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as a Final requirment for our INTROWEB course. The website can be opened in any screen size, whether desktop, tablet, or smartphone. JimTech Inc. is a fictional electronics company I created, and the website showcases the products and services it offers. The websiteâ€™s goal is to attract customers so they will purchase its offerings. To attain this, I designed the website to be visually appealing and modern looking, while ensuring the clarity of content to attain the maximum engagement of its visitors.
